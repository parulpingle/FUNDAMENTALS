In DBMS, constraints are the set of rules that ensures that when an authorized user modifies the database they do not disturb the data consistency 
and the constraints are specified within the DDL commands like “alter” and “create” command. There are several types of constraints available in DBMS and they are:

Domain constraints
Entity Integrity constraints
Referential Integrity constraints
Key constraints
In this article, we will only discuss domain constraints.

Domain Constraints
Domain Constraints are user-defined columns that help the user to enter the value according to the data type.
And if it encounters a wrong input it gives the message to the user that the column is not fulfilled properly. Or in other words,
it is an attribute that specifies all the possible values that the attribute can hold like integer, character, date, time, string, etc. 
It defines the domain or the set of values for an attribute and ensures that the value taken by the attribute must be an atomic value(Can’t be divided) from its domain.
